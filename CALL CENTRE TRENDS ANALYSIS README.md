# Call Centre Trends Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

In this project, I embarked on a journey to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze long-term trends in both customer and agent behaviour within a call centre. The objective was to provide managers with a precise understanding of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics extracted from the dataset.

## Project Phases

Here's a breakdown of the key phases I followed:

### 1. Data Analysis
   - I began by thoroughly analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and content.

### 2. Data Transformation
   - I performed necessary data transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

### 3. Calculation & Measures
   - I calculated and created measures that were essential for deriving valuable insights and trends.

### 4. Visualization Selection
   - I carefully selected appropriate visualizations to represent KPIs and metrics effectively. The choice of visuals is crucial for making data more accessible.

### 5. Dashboard Design
   - I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows managers to explore data, gain actionable insights, and track progress effectively.

## Results

The resulting Power BI dashboard provides the following benefits:

- **Actionable Insights:** Managers can access actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize project outcomes.

- **Informed Decision-Making:** The dashboard empowers managers with the ability to track long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour, facilitating more informed decision-making.

- **Efficient Progress Tracking:** By visualizing essential KPIs and metrics, the dashboard assists managers in monitoring and tracking progress effectively.

## Key Takeaway

This project showcases the power of data visualization in delivering insights and supporting decision-making. The interactive nature of the dashboard enhances its usability, ensuring that managers can extract valuable information effortlessly.
