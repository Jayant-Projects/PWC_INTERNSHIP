# Diversity and Inclusion Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

In this project, I collaborated with the Human Resources department at a telecom client to address challenges related to achieving gender balance at the executive management level. The primary objectives were to identify potential underlying factors contributing to slow progress in gender balance and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for evaluating diversity and inclusion efforts.

## Project Workflow

Here's a summary of the steps I followed:

### 1. Data Analysis
   - I conducted a thorough analysis of the available data to gain insights into the current diversity and inclusion landscape within the organization.

### 2. Data Cleaning
   - I ensured that the data used for analysis was clean and free from errors or inconsistencies.

### 3. Data Transformation
   - I performed necessary data transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis, making it suitable for deriving insights.

### 4. Calculation & Measures
   - I calculated and created measures that were essential for evaluating diversity and inclusion efforts, including hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover.

### 5. Identifying KPIs & Metrics
   - Working closely with the HR team, we identified and established relevant KPIs and metrics for assessing diversity and inclusion outcomes.

### 6. Visualization Selection
   - I carefully selected appropriate visualizations to represent the identified KPIs and metrics effectively, making the insights more accessible.

### 7. Dashboard Designing
   - I designed an informative dashboard that provides a clear understanding of the current diversity and inclusion landscape and highlights potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance.

## Results

The project delivered the following outcomes:

- **Defined KPIs:** We identified and established KPIs and metrics that are critical for evaluating diversity and inclusion efforts across various HR processes.

- **Informative Dashboard:** The dashboard I created serves as a valuable tool for HR teams to assess the organization's diversity and inclusion efforts visually.

- **Insights for Improvement:** By highlighting potential root causes contributing to the slow progress in achieving gender balance, the analysis offers insights to guide future strategies and actions for improved diversity and inclusion outcomes.

## Key Takeaway

This project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in addressing diversity and inclusion challenges. A well-designed dashboard with the right KPIs can empower organizations to take proactive measures to improve diversity and inclusion at all levels.
